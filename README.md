# Computational_Graphics
My work on this project has drastically changed my process on designing software. This project helped me better appreciate the utilization of modular code. In this project I made modular code to render each object. This allowed for more readable code and code that is easier to debug and maintain.
The design process I used when working on this project was first setting up my view matrix for each object and binding a texture to each object, then creating the vertexes for each object, then rendering each object using the attribures assigned in previous sections. The tactics I learned from this design approach 
has helped me think of the "bigger picture" of the program which will be a skill used in future work to help me better plan and implement programs.
