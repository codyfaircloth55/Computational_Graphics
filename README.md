<h2>CS 330 Computational Graphic and Visualization</h2>
<h3>Design Approach:</h3>
<p>The design process I used when working on this project was first setting up my view matrix for each object and binding a texture to each object, then creating the vertices for each object, and then rendering each object using the attributes assigned in previous sections. The tactics I learned from this design approach have helped me think of the "bigger picture" of the program which will be a skill used in future work to help me better plan and implement programs.</p>
<h3>Development Approach:</h3>
<p>My software development approach for this project was based mostly on modularity and iteration. I began with early milestones by creating my first object, the filing cabinet. I added texture and lighting in later milestones. Then, for the final project, I created vertices and mapped the locations of other objects. A lot of my approach included drawing models to understand where texture coordinates would be located and where objects should be located in relation to other objects. After adding all the code it was a process of trial and error by changing translation and scale vectors to get the image I was anticipating.</p>
<h3>Functional Skills:</h3>
<p>The skills I learned in this project and this course as a whole will be extremely valuable in my future educational and professional pursuits. Understanding the concepts associated with rendering graphics allows me to have a broader skillset in the type of applications that I can develop. Additionally, learning a widely used framework such as OpenGL gives me a good baseline to learn other frameworks such as DirectX. Professionally, I hope to work in game development, and understanding the processes of graphics rendering will be very important and useful.</p>
